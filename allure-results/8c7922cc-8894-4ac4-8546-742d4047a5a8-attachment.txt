ABOUT THE CHECKOFF

The United Soybean Board — your soy checkoff — is governed by 77 farmer-leaders from across the country with one common goal: increasing return on investment for all U.S. soybean farmers. Whether it’s through researching production practices, working with the supply chain or finding new markets for soy oil and meal both here and abroad, the soy checkoff has its farmers’ best interests at heart when investing their funds for maximum ROI.

Types of Investment

The soy checkoff focuses our investments in three key areas: education, promotion and research. By educating consumers of all types, we foster demand for U.S. soy. Through education and promotion, the checkoff has established relationships with consumers and organizations in the industrial uses space, consumer packaged goods industry and more.

Through research, the soy checkoff has joined organizations like Goodyear to develop new products using U.S. soy, which has grown demand, fostered scientific advancement and increased companies’ sustainability.

Research isn’t just for consumers. The soy checkoff is also dedicated to research to increase profitability at the farm level. With programs like Take Action, the checkoff has partnered with weed scientists to develop tools and research pesticide resistance. High oleic is one of the checkoff’s longest running programs. The program has worked with seed scientists, end users and farmers to develop high oleic soybeans which give farmers an opportunity to earn a premium without extra headaches.

Soy Partner Organizations

Like the multiple components of a soybean, there are partner organizations within the soy checkoff. The United Soybean Board administers soybean checkoff activities focusing on research, market development and expansion, while the American Soybean Association (ASA) focuses on state and national policy issues which, by law, USB can’t. Another soy partner organization is the U.S. Soybean Export Council, or USSEC, which focuses on building demand internationally for U.S. soy.
