A brand message delivered in five letters

VML plays on the 85 year heritage of the brand line “Have a break, Have a KitKat”

"No matter what you do, breaks are important." This sums up the intended message of the campaign that KitKat is perfect for taking a proper break, as you have to use both hands to snap off one of the fingers to enjoy it, so you can’t multi-task.

KitKat has famously encouraged people to have a break for decades, and this campaign takes it one step further, encouraging people to have a break without explicitly saying it. All it takes is five letters to communicate one legendary message.
