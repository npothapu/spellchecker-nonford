Description

Today’s teens face challenges that are both similar to and different from those faced by prior generations. The familiar include thinking about the future and balancing busy social lives with school. But today’s teens grew up during a pandemic separating them from their friends and driving them to nearly ubiquitous social media use. And now more than ever, they face social and political upheaval with far-reaching impacts.

With all these changes, how are teens doing? How is their overall mental health and how do the ways they spend their time impact it? How stressed are they, and does this stress get in the way of them living their lives? Jump into teens’ brains to learn about their well-being, what they need to help them prioritize their happiness, and how they navigate their increasingly hectic lives.
