What Teens Resolve to Do in 2025: Big Ambitions, Relatable Struggles

PUBLISHED DATE: JANUARY 3, 2025

What happens when you ask hundreds of teens about their hopes, dreams, and plans for the new year? You get a glimpse into the aspirations of a generation juggling big ambitions with everyday challenges. Our survey of 252 teens reveals the resolutions shaping 2025—from saving money and improving mental health to mastering pull-ups and excelling in school.
First, A Look Back
For teens, 2024 was a mixed bag. Friends and school were the year’s highlights, with 21% naming friends as the best part and 20% pointing to school. But here’s the twist—school also landed among the worst parts of 2024, tied with mental health as a top challenge (21% each). For many teens, these struggles fuel their determination to make 2025 better.
Why Teens Set Resolutions
Resolutions aren’t just a trend for teens—they’re a way to grow, challenge themselves, and take charge of their future. Half of the surveyed teens say they set resolutions to challenge themselves or work on self-improvement, while 42% are driven by a specific goal.

For some, it’s about pushing boundaries. “I resolve to be the best in all I lay my hands on,” shared a 17-year-old White male from Arizona. Others focus on practical, life-changing goals, like a 14-year-old Black female from Texas who simply wants to “make a step on my mental health.”
Top Resolutions for 2025
Financial

Saving money is a top priority for 2025, with 39% of teens resolving to boost their bank accounts. Around a quarter (28%) are even thinking about investing. Many have specific goals in mind. “I’m saving for a new car,” said a 15-year-old Black female from New Jersey, blending big dreams with careful planning.

That said, teens find meeting financial goals particularly difficult. Thirty-four percent rate them the hardest to keep, but the determination to build financial independence drives many to give it their best shot.

Mental Health and Wellness

Mental health remains a top priority for teens, with 32% resolving to focus on self-care and emotional well-being in 2025. For an 18-year-old Hispanic female from Texas, this means working to “get closer with my people,” reflecting a desire for stronger connections and a healthier mindset.

Physical health follows closely, as nearly a quarter (24%) are setting fitness goals that range from building strength to improving their diet. “I want to be able to do eight pull-ups by the end of the year,” shared a 14-year-old White female from Tennessee, hoping that a specific, tangible milestone will inspire change.

For many teens, mental and physical health are intertwined. A 14-year-old Black male from Florida captured this holistic view, saying he’ll “focus on mental health, fitness, and happiness.”

Academic and Skill-Building Goals

Academics remain a cornerstone of teens’ resolutions, with 35% aiming for better grades or higher achievements like a 4.0 GPA. “Graduating high school and starting college” is the dream for an 18-year-old Black female from North Carolina.

Meanwhile, skill-building also takes center stage, with 31% wanting to learn a new activity or hobby. A 19-year-old Black male from Texas said he plans to “learn a technical skill, invest, and work out daily,” embodying this generation’s multifaceted ambitions.
How Teens Plan to Achieve Their Resolutions
Teens aren’t just dreamers—they’re planners. Two-thirds (67%) say they’ll create a schedule to stay on track, while nearly half (47%) will seek support from friends and family. Apps and digital tools are also popular, with 38% using them to track progress.

Despite their optimism, teens know it won’t be easy. Distractions (35%) and shifting priorities (28%) loom as the biggest obstacles. But they’re confident in their ability to succeed—39% believe they’re better at sticking to resolutions than most people.
