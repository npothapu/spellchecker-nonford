I Will Always Be Me
The book that banks your voice

CLIENT

Dell Technologies and Intel

OFFICE

United States

Dell Technologies and Intel have a strong partnership, propelled by the shared belief in the power of technology to drive humanity forward. Both companies have a long-standing relationship with the Motor Neurone Disease Association (MNDA) to create technology solutions for people living with Motor Neurone Disease (MND). MND is a neurodegenerative condition that deteriorates nerve cells that control muscles and ultimately takes away a person’s ability to speak. Even though voice banking technology is available, only about 12% of people with MND in the UK have banked their voices. Dell Technologies and Intel came to us with a brief to find a way to get more people living with MND to bank their voices.

Giving people the words to express what they might be feeling, but also helping them continue expressing themselves in their own voice even after it’s gone — I would have never imagined a book could do that.
