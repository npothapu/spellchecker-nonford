Colgate believes in the power of individual smiles and is on a mission to celebrate them. In a world where uniformity often overshadows uniqueness, Colgate's inspiring campaign, "My Smile Is My Superpower," aims to redefine beauty standards and boost confidence, especially among Gen Z. Award-winning actress Uzo Aduba joins forces with Colgate to inspire everyone to embrace their unique smiles.

When I was younger, I fixated on the gap in my teeth—so much so that it kept me from smiling and being authentically myself. I’m excited to be partnering with Colgate to share my smile story in the hopes of inspiring others to own their smiles just the way they are.

Our research has shown that when your smile doesn’t match the idealized version portrayed in the world, it’s easy to doubt its beauty. We at Colgate know that there is power in every smile.
