What We Do
Health
We are a global healthcare communications network that creates connected brands for life

JOIN US

At the heart of health is the story of life – all the highs and lows, ambitions, and possibilities. But facing a health challenge can suddenly pull people away from these stories, knocking them off course.

Our purpose is to bridge this gap, bringing people closer to life and all its meaning, gaining a deeper understanding of Health Care Professionals and patients’ needs, behaviours and lived experiences through what we call ‘radical empathy’.

VML Health creates connected brands that get to the heart, bringing people closer to the lives they want to live.

Get to the heart. Connect for life.

We create connected brands for life.

Robust capabilities? We’ve got those nailed. But what makes us different is how we partner as a broader team. We connect across the entire brand lifecycle. Across healthcare ecosystems. And across the world. One team, everywhere at once.


We’re dedicated to closing gaps in care and championing health equity. Because where you live shouldn’t determine if you live. And neither should age, ethnicity, or socioeconomics. That’s why we’re so passionate about connecting communities to advance health outcomes for everyone.

How do we do it? We apply data, science and creativity to get to the heart of things, delivering more powerful and personal health experiences. And best of all, we’re patient led because the people we serve drive everything we do.

CAPABILITIES

Expertise? We’ve got you covered. From early commercialisation through Loss of Exclusivity. Our work spans a broad definition of health, creating brands and experiences for clients in pharma, OTC, healthcare providers and nonprofits. As well as patient groups, retailers, medical devices, payment systems & platforms too.

Health Offices Around the World

We have a global network of dedicated VML Health offices across North America, Sydney, Shanghai, Tokyo, London and Manchester in the UK, Madrid and Barcelona in Spain, Milan, Paris, Frankfurt and Zurich. Our health teams can also be found integrated within the 124 VML offices around the world.

But it’s not that we are one of the largest networks of specialist health teams in the world. What matters to us, is that we are the most connected. As it’s only by being connected to each other, and to our communities, and clients, that we can get to the heart of health.
