Where Teens Talk Politics

PUBLISHED DATE: OCTOBER 21, 2024

Politics permeates the daily lives of American teenagers, whether they actively seek it out or not. A recent survey of 1,790 teens reveals how discussions with family, friends, and teachers shape their political perspectives, while social media provides a platform for sharing and engaging with diverse opinions.
Around the Dinner Table
For many teens, political awareness begins at home. A significant 62% of those surveyed report having political discussions with their parents at least weekly. As a 13-year-old White male from Arizona explains, "I am interested in politics because my family cares about it." This sentiment is echoed by a 13-year-old female from California: "I hear about it all the time in my household, so I end up getting involved in the conversation, making me more and more interested."
With Friends and at School
Over half of the surveyed teens (52%) say they discuss politics with their friends at least weekly. A 14-year-old Asian male from Maryland, for example, says he stays up to date on political events specifically so he can participate in discussions with his peers. Even those not actively looking to talk about politics find it a frequent topic in class. A 15-year-old nonbinary Hispanic person notes, "It isn't something that comes up in conversations with my friends, but sometimes it comes up in news or in my Social Studies class."
Sharing Views on Social Media
Teens are more likely to share or repost political content they agree with (23%) than to create original content (18%). This preference for sharing curated content reflects a broader trend in social media use among teens. (To go deeper into teens social media habits, download our report.)

Additionally, teens of color tend to engage more frequently in political discussions, particularly with their families, where 35% report receiving much of their political information.
