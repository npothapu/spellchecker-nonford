2025 Teen Trends: Wellness and Personal Growth Are “In”

PUBLISHED DATE: JANUARY 14, 2025

When we asked teens what’s trending in 2025, the answers went deeper than fashion or viral challenges – they shared their aspirations. “Growth and development … striving to be better version of myself,” says one 16-year-old female from California, in what feels more like a New Year's resolution than a trend prediction.

This self-improvement mindset drives what teens say is “in” for 2025:
83% say skincare
78% point to boundary-setting
74% prioritize sleep

It's not just talk – McKinsey's Future of Wellness report confirms that Gen Z and millennials are now the biggest spenders on wellness products and services across global markets.


Beyond Wellness
What else is “in” for 2025? Sustainability and self-expression continue to shape teen culture:
70% say thrifted clothing is trending
68% love using real cameras for authentic content
67% embrace gender-neutral fashion
What's Out
When asked what's “out” in 2025, teens focused less on specific trends and more on attitudes they're leaving behind. A 16-year-old from Texas is done with “being lazy, hating, bullying, and putting people down.”

Fashion-wise, early 2000s styles are losing steam, with fewer than half of teens considering them relevant. Social media habits are shifting too. A 14-year-old male from Colorado predicts more “goal-setting and trying to be less online.”
The Verdict
For 2025, authenticity and growth are the new benchmarks of “cool.” Teens are rewriting what it means to be trendy – by putting their well-being front and center.
