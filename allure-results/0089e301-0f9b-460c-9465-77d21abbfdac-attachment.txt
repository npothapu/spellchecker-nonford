Sound Scales
A unique audio innovation tells consumers what's left in their bottle and offers ideas on how to enjoy it

VML and Bailey's turn a business challenge into an opportunity to inspire and delight consumers.

Removing the need for guestimates and measures, customers can simply visit SoundScales.Baileys.com on their mobile device, tap the prompt ‘Listen,' and gently blow over the top of their Baileys bottle, where Baileys "Sound Scales" will not only tell them how much Baileys they have left in their bottle, but suggest some deliciously indulgent treat recipes with what remains, including Baileys Brioche French Toast, Baileys Cheesecake, Baileys Espresso Martini and the seasonal Baileys Easter Shake.

After the festive period where Baileys sees a surge in purchase and consumption, the iconic bottle and much-loved brand can often be hidden away in the alcohol cabinet out of sight and out of mind. With Sound Scales, Baileys playfully turns a business challenge into an opportunity to inspire and delight consumers with treats and discount offers in an innovative way.
