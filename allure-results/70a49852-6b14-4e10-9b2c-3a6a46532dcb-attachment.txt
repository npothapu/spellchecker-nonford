Don't Delete Menu
Unexpected offers made people think twice before deleting us

CLIENT

Wendy's

OFFICE

Argentina
United States

When 1 out of 2 apps, on average, is deleted in Argentina, Wendy's is stepping up to encourage users to keep the app. Hidden in the app's shortcut menu, users will find a secret 'don't delete' menu with special offers to encourage them to stay.

We realized there was a window to hack users' logic. To prevent them from uninstalling the app, we created an irresistible offer in a secret menu located in the same place where people usually delete the app.
