Future Focus: Teens on Education and Careers

While the immediate urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic has passed, teens today continue to feel its impact and – whether they’re aware of it or not – their choices have been informed by such tremendous upheaval. During the height of the pandemic, several studies indicated that teens were turning away from higher education – especially four-year college – and turning to community colleges, other training, or careers. Many of these studies implied that teens put a high premium on the location of their jobs, arguably over other job features.
