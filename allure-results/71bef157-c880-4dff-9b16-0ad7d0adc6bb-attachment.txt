OFFICE

India
As the world’s most global brand, Coke is about bringing people together and Coke Studio gives artists a stage to collaborate.

With Coke Studio coming back to India after an eight year hiatus, we needed to reinvent what Coke Studio Bharat would stand for while staying true to the brand value of authenticity. Our objective was to make Coke Studio Bharat a stage for India’s unrepresented cultures and languages and build a community for them to be a part of pop culture.

It’s heartening to see artists, creators and fans coming together on 'Khalasi' to create their own renditions and videos, turning the song into a success with 4.5 billion views. It exemplifies the vision of Coke Studio Bharat, authentically taking regional talent and music forms in the country to a global landscape.
