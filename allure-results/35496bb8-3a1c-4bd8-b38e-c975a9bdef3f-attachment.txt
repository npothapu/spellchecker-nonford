Two of the most well-known brands in the world come together for a truly "marvelous" promotion.

Coca-Cola and Marvel joined forces to deliver a groundbreaking campaign that brings the Marvel Universe to life in an unprecedented way. This unique collaboration offers fans the chance to collect limited-edition Coca-Cola packs featuring 38 Marvel character designs, along with an immersive AR experience that extends the excitement beyond the physical product. The campaign was developed by WPP Open X, led by VML.

We took the traditional marketing paradigm and redefined it in the best way possible. The result is an unprecedented campaign that taps into the power of the Marvel Universe — which is heading into its 85th year of beloved characters — and tells stories in a way that can only be done when Coca-Cola and Disney come together.
