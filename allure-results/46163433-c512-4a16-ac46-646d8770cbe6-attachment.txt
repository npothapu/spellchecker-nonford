Decoding web3 and the metaverse

What is web3? Simply put, it is a decentralized, blockchain-based internet. It is also being touted as the next iteration of the internet - one that will enable a seamless fusion of virtual and physical life.


The metaverse, meanwhile, is the collection of digital experiences and interfaces that will be supported by web3. At its most basic level, the metaverse is an extension of our lives enhanced by technology. Currently, it exists as a series of distinct virtual worlds - think Fortnite’s concert series, Vans World in Roblox, or Horizon Workrooms by Meta. In the future, however, the metaverse will expand into an interconnected and limitless world where our digital and physical lives fully converge.

The web3 ecosystem represents almost limitless new opportunities for forward-thinking brands.

The metaverse allows you to harness the power of a burgeoning network of immersive 3D worlds to engage your consumers in entirely new ways. Meanwhile blockchain technology enables you to store and broker an almost infinite array of new digital assets such as NFTs or virtual goods.

Almost anything is possible within the web3 environment. Brands exploring this frontier of marketing need a guide. That’s why we created POSSIBLE Worldwide.

As experts in the end-to-end customer experience, we have all the necessary capabilities to help you succeed in the web3 space. We’ve developed an approach to help you experiment, execute and grow in this burgeoning new sector.

POSSIBLE Worldwide has been specially created to give you a deep understanding of what the metaverse is, provide actionable insights into the challenges and opportunities faced by your brand in your sector and then stretch to expert concept and delivery.

We’ve helped the world’s biggest brands develop web3 strategies, take their first step into the metaverse and experiment with NFTs. We remain at the forefront research, intelligence and thought-leadership into the metaverse and blockchain technologies.
