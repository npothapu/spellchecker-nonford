United Soybean Board Farmer-Leaders Greenlight Forward-Thinking FY25 Budget

Across the priority areas of Innovation & Technology, Health & Nutrition, Infrastructure & Connectivity, Export Promotion, and Communication & Education, FY25 investments drive value for U.S. Soy through differentiation, resilience, and reputation.

Baltimore, Md. (July 18, 2024) — The 77 farmer-leaders serving on the United Soybean Board approved $173.8 million for the 2025 fiscal year budget. The budget supports research, promotion and education investment portfolios selected through USB’s Portfolio Development Process. These investments drive demand for U.S. Soy and return value to all U.S. soybean farmers.

“With wet conditions in the north and dry conditions in the south, growing soybeans has been challenging for many across the nation,” said Steve Reinhard, USB chair and farmer from Ohio. “One of the benefits of our checkoff is that farmer-led investments continually focus on building a more resilient soybean to withstand weather conditions, pests and weed pressure while also prioritizing demand creation. As we look ahead to FY25 investments, I’ve been impressed with the innovative and novel ideas by our soybean farmers to not only protect soy production, but grow our market across the animal ag sector, biofuels, and product innovations.”

The board’s approval during the organization’s summer meeting July 8-11, hosted by the Maryland Soybean Board and the Mid-Atlantic Soybean Association in Baltimore, Maryland, puts in motion a strategic portfolio that focuses on growing preference and increasing the resiliency of U.S. Soy. Priority areas include Innovation & Technology, Health & Nutrition, and Infrastructure & Connectivity across supply and demand investments. In addition, the Communication & Education Committee aims to enhance the U.S. Soy and checkoff reputation across key audiences, and USB’s export promotion investments focus on differentiating U.S. soybeans, red meat, poultry, and eggs around the globe.

Included below are the committee lead’s perspectives on FY25 investments that will impact soybean farmers the most across the three strategic priority areas:

Innovation & Technology (I&T)

Supply: “We’re investing in research to speed up the process to get biotech soybeans to the market, so we’re ahead of the curve in combating a variety of pests, weeds and diseases. We’re also excited about soybeans with deeper roots that store more carbon and may be more resilient to drought or flooding. Our work group is also focused on expanding high oleic soybeans from maturity groups 0-7, so more farmers have access to premiums in growing this specialty soybean.” — Kurt Maurath, I&T supply work group lead and Kansas farmer
Demand: “We’re focused on expanding soybean oil use in sustainable aviation fuel, which is a 27 billion-gallon market. We’re also pursuing marine and rail applications and confirmed that all six Class 1 railroads are committed to scaling up biofuel use in FY25. Our soy-based firefighting foam is also gaining traction because of its environmental benefits being biodegradable and health benefits replacing PFAS1, commonly referred to as ‘forever chemicals.’ Similarly, we’re engaging in carbon black research to make tire particles a more renewable alternative.” — Neal Bredehoeft, I&T demand work group lead and Missouri farmer

Health & Nutrition (H&N)

Supply: “Whether it’s nematodes, slugs or deer that feed on our crops, we’re taking a wider-lens approach. We’ll compile research that already exists across our Qualified State Soybean Boards, extension networks, and consortiums and identify how much it’s economically damaging our crop. Then we’ll determine whether biologicals, chemical treatments or production practices work best in managing pests across different soil types, tillage methods and times of application.” — Laurie Isley, H&N supply work group lead and Michigan farmer
Demand: “With animal agriculture being our biggest customer, especially poultry, swine and dairy, soy’s role in maintaining herd health is a big opportunity. In collaboration with USB’s industry animal nutrition advisory group, our research shows that soy meal may provide antiviral and anti-inflammatory benefits. It also has strong economic value and efficient conversion rates. These factors help get animals using U.S. Soy to the market faster while using fewer inputs, which is a key differentiator for sustainability.” — Dawn Scheier, H&N demand work group lead and South Dakota farmer

Infrastructure & Connectivity (I&C)

Supply: “We are exploring a partnership that utilizes artificial intelligence and tools like infrared and visible spectrum imaging for soybean grading. This takes out the guesswork and human error and hopefully gets rid of the ‘Monday morning hangover grade’ or ‘Friday afternoon let’s get out of here early grade.’ Our work group feels this will provide real possibilities to bring profitability to farmers not only down south, but across the country.” — Robb Ewoldt, I&C supply work group lead and Iowa farmer
Demand: “We’re excited about a soy-based chemistry curriculum being developed for post-secondary students. Our thought process is that if we can train the future workforce to start with soy as a base, it could grow our market exponentially. Some of the current biobased products that we’re investing in, with the intent to commercialize, include soy-based lubricants with brands like DEWALT, Craftsman, and Black & Decker, and using high oleic soybean oil for fire-resistant hydraulic oil.” — Tom Frisch, I&C demand work group lead and Minnesota farmer

 

Communication & Education Committee

“Growing the reputation of U.S. Soy and our soy checkoff opens doors to new opportunities and increases farmer profitability. One of the investments in FY25 that our committee places immense value on is working with STEM educators from coast to coast to promote agriculture through hands-on activities, such as teaching students about the process of biodiesel production and the sustainability attributes of biofuels. As we continue to diversify soy uses, whether it’s biodiesel, turf, tires, shoes or plywood, not only does it elevate soy as a sustainable solution for our customers and consumers, it reminds the half-million U.S. soybean farmers that their checkoff investments drive value back to the farm.” — Matt Gast, Communication & Education Committee chair and North Dakota farmer

Export Promotion

“Now that soybean oil is the primary driver of crush to meet biofuel demand, we’re looking at unique investments to find uses for soybean meal. Whole soybean and soybean meal exports across the globe to support global hog production and egg-laying production, while increasing inclusion in those diets, is a big part of moving that pile. But that works alongside exporting value-added poultry products and red meat. Because when we feed livestock domestically, then export it, that supports U.S. agriculture and the economy overall. We’re also proud to export U.S. Soy for human consumption, providing a high-quality, complete protein in foods such as tempeh, tofu, soymilk, natto and miso.” — April Hemmes, Demand Action Team chair and Iowa farmer

USB’s Vice Chair and Nebraska farmer Ed Lammers, who oversees the Value Alignment Committee and facilitates the FY25 portfolio development, reflects on the culmination of approving next year’s budget and shares, “We have been hard at work these last several months in discussions with our farmer-leaders to identify our priorities for each work group for FY25. We continue to fund long-term research in soybean meal inclusion in swine diets, as well as investments in infrastructure to expand and modernize inland waterways, railways and ports. As demand continues to grow, our checkoff dollars continue to work for all U.S. soybean farmers.”
