WPP has been named a Leader among commerce service providers in The Forrester Wave™: Commerce Services, Q2 2024 report. According to Forrester, WPP shines with flexible creativity in its commerce strategy anchored by WPP Open, the company’s intelligent marketing operating system.

The study assessed ten providers of commerce services based on their current offering, strategy and market presence, measuring providers against 24 criteria.

Among those evaluated, the research finds that WPP had the highest score in the current offering category and excels in overall commerce strategic strength, with additional strength in content production and in retail media. The Forrester report states that WPP uses "GroupM’s scale as a global media buyer and its own extensive retailer and marketplace relationships with Amazon and others to help brands and retailers optimize media and transactions.”


The marriage of creative and technology has always been at the heart of what we deliver for our clients. It’s inspiring to see Forrester rank WPP as a Leader in commerce services and recognize WPP as a provider with ‘flexible creativity in commerce.’ We’re focused on ensuring the total commerce experience is at the forefront for today’s modern marketers. It’s paramount to VML’s positioning and our trilogy of practices across brand experience, commerce, and customer experience which we leverage to create connected brands for our client partners.
Jon Cook
Global CEO, VML

The company received the highest score attainable in data, analytics and AI criterion. The report noted that “WPP excels in overall commerce strategic strength, hitting on all cylinders, leading with genAI innovation in its Open platform, and rocking the technology and marketplace partner ecosystem”. WPP also received top scores possible in the social commerce, CRM services, talent strategy and global delivery strategy criteria. Additionally, Forrester noted the simplification of WPP’s commerce structure, with the company aggregating its commerce services under the VML brand following the merger of VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson.


Forrester’s recognition of the commerce offer that now sits within VML is incredibly validating. We’re proud of the world-class team we’ve assembled to deliver leading-edge creative, media and technology expertise for clients at a time of unprecedented growth in the space. From shaping commerce strategy to galvanizing engagement and conversion across all channels, we’re ensuring brands are delivering memorable, discoverable, and ultimately frictionless commerce experiences to its consumers. Our partnership with GroupM makes WPP truly an end-to-end leader in Commerce for our clients.
