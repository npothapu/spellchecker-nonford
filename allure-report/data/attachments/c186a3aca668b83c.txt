This Is Not a Game
Alerting young gamers and parents about the dangers of online gaming and real-life criminal grooming

CLIENT

OFFICE

Mexico
A short film that emphasizes the necessity of a safe digital environment for minors.

According to the Executive Secretariat of the National System for Comprehensive Protection of Girls, Boys and Adolescents, over 75% of the online video game profiles that interact with minors belong to strangers. This poses predatory risks like grooming, human trafficking, forced labor and kidnapping.

At Movistar, we recognize the power of technology to generate more human connections. Through ‘This Is Not a Game,' we're raising awareness about the risks of video games and inviting players and caregivers of minors to take control and get involved to detect and prevent risks associated with online gaming interactions. People give meaning to technology, and with proper information, we can use it responsibly.
