Transforming how the construction industry works

OFFICE

United States

Managing a jobsite is overwhelming for site managers and foremen in the construction industry. You have to keep hundreds of workers safe from serious injury or worse. And you have to keep hundreds of pieces of equipment moving in perfect unison just to make a profit.

Idle equipment accounts for 30% profit loss in all construction jobs. So United Rentals, America’s largest equipment rental provider, was determined to provide unprecedented visibility into jobsite management to help its customers be safer and more efficient.

We collaborated to turn data into the most powerful tool in the construction industry, creating a tool that transformed an analog fleet management workflow into a streamlined data-fueled, digital choreography.
