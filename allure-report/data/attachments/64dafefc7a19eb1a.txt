Celebrating VML's First Year, Together
Jan 13, 2025
A year of creativity, innovation, and success as VML unites to redefine the agency landscape

As we mark the first anniversary of the merger between VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson, we celebrate a year filled with remarkable achievements and groundbreaking innovations.

This union has transformed us into VML, a powerhouse agency creating connected brands to drive growth for our client partners around the globe. Our journey together has been nothing short of extraordinary, showcasing what can be accomplished when two world-class agencies unite with a shared vision.

VML's heritage is built on more than 300 years of combined experience and expertise, where creativity meets technology, and diverse perspectives ignite inspiration.

With roots tracing back to the founding of J. Walter Thompson in 1864, Y&R in 1923, Wunderman in 1958, and VML in 1992, we have forged a new path as a growth partner that is equal parts creative agency, consultancy, and technology powerhouse.

The merger of VMLY&R and Wunderman Thompson to create VML on January 1, 2024, marks the latest chapter in this storied legacy.

The future of building strong brands and businesses requires the interconnectivity of brand experience, commerce, and customer experiences. Our first year as VML has proven that together, we are capable of achieving what no other agency or consultancy can offer. We are redefining modern marketing and setting new standards for creativity and innovation.
Jon Cook
Global CEO, VML

In our inaugural year, VML redefined the agency landscape by integrating Brand Experience (BX), Customer Experience (CX), Commerce, and Enterprise Solutions. This connected approach has allowed us to meet the complex needs of modern marketers, driving growth for iconic global brands.

Our collective efforts have not gone unnoticed, with VML being named one of the four most awarded agencies at Cannes Lions, as well as recognized in numerous Forrester landscape reports. VML was named a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave: CX Strategy Consulting Services, Q4 2024, and was part of WPP being named a Leader in The Forrester Wave: Commerce Services, Q2 2024, and a Strong Performer in The Forrester Wave: Adobe Services, Q3 2024.

Our success at VML is grounded in the trust and support of our valued client partners, who form the bedrock of our agency.

We are privileged to work with some of the world's most respected brands, building longstanding relationships that foster innovation and growth.

2024 brought many new clients to the VML family who we are so proud to work alongside.


The strength of VML lies in our people and our commitment to positive impact. Through initiatives like THRIVE and Learn.VML.com, we empower employee growth while fostering inclusion through ERG programs and scholarships.

We also prioritize community engagement, with the VML Foundation's charitable giving exceeding $3.2 million this year.

Our first Foundation Day together marked the 20th anniversary of VML Worldwide Foundation Day, where over 26,000 employees across more than 100 offices participated in volunteer projects, supporting over 250 non-profit causes.


As we celebrate our first year as VML, it brings not only the typical excitement for the cake and celebrations, but the anticipation and enthusiasm about the journey ahead.

Here’s to all the momentum we’ll create in the years to come!
