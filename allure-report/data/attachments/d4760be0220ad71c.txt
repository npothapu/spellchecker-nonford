Mayo Cat
The cat on a mission to save human food

CLIENT

Hellmann's

OFFICE

New York

The dog days are over! This year, America's favorite mayonnaise, Hellmann's, has introduced Mayo Cat – an adorable feline who inspires America to use Hellmann's to save their leftovers. Barbie actor and SNL headliner Kate McKinnon plays Mayo Cat's mom, and there's a surprise cameo from, shall we say, an old friend.

With the teaser being named one of its Top 5 Super Bowl Teasers by Fast Company and the 60-second spot making its debut as an exclusive on CBS Mornings, the campaign has garnered over 18 billion impressions to date and extensive media coverage from The New York Times, Fast Company, PEOPLE, Forbes, CNN, USA Today and The Drum, amongst many other global media outlets.

Beyond TV, the campaign is supported by activations across channels including social, shopper, OOH and PR. Not only is Mayo Cat seen rising to fame in the spot, but she's a celebrity IRL featured on the amazing Las Vegas Sphere, taking over Hellmann's social channels on the run-up to Game Day and bagging herself a couple of in-studio interviews.

After three years of making Hellmann’s Super Bowl ads, Mayo Cat may be our best one yet. It captures the essence of pop culture and how quickly a regular person or even a cat can morph into a celebrity overnight. And as for one of our returning characters, Hellmann’s knows better than anyone to never throw out a good thing.
