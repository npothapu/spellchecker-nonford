Organic Exemption Requests
According to the Exemption of Organic Products From Assessment Under a Commodity Promotion Law (more here), this rule implements the provisions of section 10004 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 and modifies the organic assessment exemption regulations under 23 Federal marketing orders and 22 research and promotion programs (commodity promotion programs). This rule amends the current regulations to allow persons that produce, handle, market, process, manufacture, feed, or import “organic” and “100 percent organic” products to be exempt from paying assessments associated with commodity promotion activities conducted under a commodity promotion program administered by the USDA-Agricultural Marketing Service.

For more information about organic exemption requests, please email usborganics@unitedsoybean.org or call the United Soybean Board office at (636) 530-1777. The organic exemption request form can be found here.
