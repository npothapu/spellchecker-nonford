Thanks for Coke-Creating
Embracing local culture and creativity through iconic branding

CLIENT

Coca-Cola
Instead of correcting local interpretations of Coca-Cola's logo, we encouraged them.

Coca-Cola's innovative global campaign "Every Coca-Cola is Welcome," also known as "Thanks for Coke-Creating," celebrates local interpretations of its iconic logo by bodegas, shopkeepers and artists, creating a tapestry of cultural diversity and creativity. The campaign was developed by WPP Open X, led by VML and supported by Essence Mediacom and Ogilvy PR.

These visuals are so meaningful and impactful. Signs for local businesses capturing colors of cultures and personalities of communities. We're proud to celebrate and embrace their work.

What is so special about this campaign is that the Coca-Cola brand is being reinterpreted in every corner of the world through countless creative expressions. And these reinterpretations are only possible because the Coca-Cola logo is so ingrained in culture across the globe.
