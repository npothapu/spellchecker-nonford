The Font that Saves Eyes
The only monospace font designed to reduce eyestrain for computer programmers

Intel’s commitment to accessibility and open-source initiatives led VML’s research team to discover that developer eye strain was a significant issue, with no typefaces specifically addressing it. To strengthen connections with the developer community, VML and Frere-Jones Type collaborated with low-vision and legally blind developers, focusing on legibility and gathering feedback to refine the design. By releasing the typeface as open-source on GitHub, Intel built trust with developers. The project resulted in many awards, positive feedback on inclusivity, reduced eye strain, improved coding accuracy and enhanced brand affinity, with many devs adopting it as their default coding typeface.

The Intel One Mono font is a game-changer in the world of digital typography. Designed for optimal readability on any screen, it marries form and function, setting a new standard for user interfaces. This innovation is not just about looks; it's about enhancing the way we interact with technology daily.

Subjective ideas about what might be considered beautiful at 160 points on a poster doesn’t mean a whole lot when you’re reading at 13 pixels on screen and can’t tell why your code is throwing an error. Intel One Mono is designed to be at its best in those circumstances.
