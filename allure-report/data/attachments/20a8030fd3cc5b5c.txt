VML Spain has captured the world’s attention with the launch of the first-ever Heinz AI Cookbook.

An innovative new AI Cookbook bridges the gap between food and technology by creating recipes that can teach both humans and AI how to cook.

It's not easy to simmer an AI prompt. For that reason, and with the purpose of inspiring people, we think it's time to share how good AI chefs cook their recipes using generative AI. We think it's a great idea to give open access to the magic of prompting to anyone who wants to create the best recipes and images with the Heinz standard using the latest and most advanced Gen AI models.
